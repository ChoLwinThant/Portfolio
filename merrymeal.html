            <h2>Register Function</h2>
            <p>The registration process for MerryMeal organization offers separate forms for members, partners, and
                volunteers, inspired by research on similar Meals on Wheels websites. Each form requires users to submit
                their name, email, password, and an image providing evidence relevant to their application. Admin
                approval is necessary for all registrations, with the submitted images serving as crucial evidence for
                eligibility. For partners, FDA approval images are required, while volunteers are encouraged to provide
                details of their abilities or certificates. Upon review, the admin informs applicants via email of their
                approval or rejection, ensuring only qualified individuals gain access to MerryMeal's services.</p>

                help can donate without any hassle. To donate, you just need to provide your name, how much you want to
                give, and your payment details. You don't have to sign up or log in to donate, making it simple and

            <h2>Functions for Partner</h2>
            <p>For menu planning, partners will be able to upload the menu that they will be providing. Those menus will
                be assessed by the admin whether the meals are safe and suitable for the members or not. In this way,
                menu planning and food safety management is carried out in our application. Partners will have to login
                first to upload the menu that they want to provide by filling the form of meal name, ingredients,
                description and the image of the meal. They should put the information about the menu correctly and
                carefully since admin will be determining the result for the approval of menu. Only after the admin
                approval, the menu will be displayed in to member side for the members to make order.</p>

            <h2>Functions for Member</h2>
            <p>Members will be able to make orders by filling and submitting the order form. In the order form, they
                will need to put set id of meal set that they want to order, the day they want and their location in
                latitude and longitude. Members can see information of menu displayed in the menu page. The menus are
                healthy and safe for everyone that members can make orders with no worries because those are uploaded
                only after the admin approval. After members submit the order form by clicking create order button, the
                data will be stored in the database. There is also a constraint that the delivering hot noon meal
                service will be available only for weekdays within 10-kilometer radius of the kitchen. If the order is
                for weekends or if the member’s location is not within 10-kilometer radius from the outsource kitchen,
                they will be provided frozen meal. To satisfy this constraint, the program will calculate the distance
                between member and partner’s kitchen that will provide the meal which member wants to order and also
                check the day which member wants. According to calculation result and the day that member selects, a
                message informing the member whether they will get hot meal or frozen meal will be displayed. Moreover,
                members will be able to request care giver for care service. </p>

            <h2>Functions for Volunteer</h2>
            <p>Orders and caregiver requests that are made by members will be carried out by the volunteers. There are
                two pages for volunteers in each of which will be retrieving the data about orders and caregiver
                requests from the members. Volunteers can take the pending delivery and care giver tasks and once they
                have taken a task, the program provides functions to manage these tasks. In the application, once the
                volunteer has taken a pending task, it will be moved to that volunteer taken tasks table and no other
                volunteer will be able to see the task. In this way, there will not be conflicts happening. After they
                have finished the task, they can finish it.</p>
